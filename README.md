# owm
Script which gives weather information about any city across the world.

Introduction-

This is a simple script to get the details about weather in your city.
This script is based on openWeatherMap(OWM) api.
You don't need to generate the api key as I've already done it and added it in the script.

Installation-
Firstly you need to have >=Python 2.7 installed on your system. Then you need a wrapper for owm.
The library which acts as a wrapper for owm is "requests" which helps you to connect to owm.
That's the reason I've imported requests in my code.

How to run-
1.clone/download the owm repository.

git clone https://www.github.com/ronishz/owm.git

2.cd to the "owm" repository

3.run the owm1.py script

python owm1.py

4.Enter the name of the city for which you want the weather information.

5.You'll get the complete information about the current date's weather based on timespan of every 3hrs.

Note: Both owm.py and owm1.py should be in the same repository. Also a output file output.txt will be generated in the same directory. So that you can refer to it later as well.



Thankyou!
